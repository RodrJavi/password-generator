# password-generator

This challenge is for the third week of UMO coding bootcamp.

## Objective
The purpose of this challenge was to utilize the Javascript we learned throughout the week to make a functioning password generator out of starter code we were provided. Upon clicking the generate button the user is prompted if the password will have lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters.
